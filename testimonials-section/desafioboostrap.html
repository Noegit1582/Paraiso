                            make
                            a
                            trsnsition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I

                            up
                            for
                            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                            thereafter.
                            The
                            next
                            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the
                            course,
                            I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
